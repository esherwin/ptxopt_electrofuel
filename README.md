This is documentation for the Power-to-X Optimization tool (PtXOpt), for optimization-based techno-economic analysis of electrofuels and other renewable electricty-based power-to-X technologies.
The model is written in Analytica. To view the model, its structure, its inputs, and its results, you will need a version of the Analytica software, which runs on Microsoft Windows. The Free 101 version is available at no cost and will be able to run most aspects of the model. It is available for download here: https://lumina.com/products/free101/
Running the optimization itself currently requires a license of Analytica Optimizer with the Gurobi Solver.

At present, all model documentation is internal. The front end of the model shows key results from the paper, with quick navigation to the model structure.
